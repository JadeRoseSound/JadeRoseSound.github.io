I am a musician, sound designer, luthier, DIY electronics enthusiast, and performing artist. My goal is to combine my passions to create spiritually affirming artwork.

In 2018, I released my first album [Moonstone](https://jaderose.bandcamp.com/album/moonstone), my heartfelt attempt to create dynamic, emotional music using synthesizers and electronics. [I used modular synthesis, experimental sound design,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ3pzmIGqNE) as well as experimental software sequencers and sound generators I made for this project. Some of the sound generators are available for download on this website.

My second album, The Valley,  is finished and will be released on vinyl this spring. It is a comission I created as a sound track for an art store.

My sound design experience includes creating and collaborating on award winning sound libraries and synthesizer presets for [Wave Alchemy](https://www.wavealchemy.co.uk/sfx-collection-03/pid166/)

I also have professional experience repairing and building electronics and stringed instruments I update those projects on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jade_rose_music/). I studied luthiery from 2014-2015 at Minnesota Southeast Technical.
