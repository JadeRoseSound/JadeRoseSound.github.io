[Moonstone](https://jaderose.bandcamp.com/album/moonstone) is my heartfelt attempt to create dynamic, emotional music using synthesizers and electronics. I used modular synthesis, experimental sound design, as well as experimental software sequencers and sound generators I made for this project. Oh, and lots of math too ^-^ 

Beyond the techniques for achieving the sounds, I wanted the album to be interesting musically as well as technically. I wanted to reflect raw emotional energy in sequenced music. Cyberpunk art and concepts were also an inspiration for this album.

The full album can be purcahsed on [Bandcamp](https://jaderose.bandcamp.com/album/moonstone) as well as Itunes, Spotify, etc.

I also perform original music with an animated singing robot I created named Hexter. A video of a performance is in the link above.
